## Undergrad Electrical Engineering Student 

Welcome to my world (or my GitHub profile, same thing ha)!
Despite me being an Electrical Engineering student, I have a lot of passion for code. As little as 13 years old, I started writing code. The ROBLOX platform has introduced me to a lot of coding concepts, which have become natural to me over the years.

For those more curious about my life, here are interesting facts about me!
- Ferrets are my favorite animal! They are so cute!
- I am music crazy. I easily go over 100K+ minutes on Spotify each year.
- I like homemade things. I go out my way to buy from small shops to support them.
- I am interested in micro-electronics, specifically how they are designed and manufactured.

Here is a timeline of my coding-life :)
| Period | Milestone |
|--------|-----------|
| **2013 - 2018** | Started coding in Lua, mostly small projects |
| **2019 - 2020** | Released a game alongside 4 other members. Reached nearly 1M users |
| **2021 - 2024** | Released some Open-Source Lua code to GitHub, getting some attention on Developer Forums |
| **2025 - now** | Decided to expand my horizon, currently learning JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust! |

And finally, here is the stack of my languages! (Get it!)
